"""R26 control-fires test for scripts/check_rag_index_freshness.py: plant the exact
staleness this script exists to catch (must FAIL) and a clean, up-to-date state (must
PASS), against a synthetic commit graph rather than live repo history -- so the test does
not depend on git state changing under it as the real repo moves forward.

The synthetic graph, as a DAG (letters are commit SHAs, '<-' is 'is a parent of'):

    A <- B <- C          A: original facts + regen both built
              |
              +-- D      D: facts edited again AFTER C (the regen), on top of C

`is_ancestor(x, y)` below encodes exactly that graph: is_ancestor('A','C') is True,
is_ancestor('D','C') is False (D is NOT an ancestor of C -- C came first).
